## [Introduction to Data](Introduction-to-Data/README.md)

Using descriptive statistics and visualizations in Excel this section aims to develop and communicate insights discovered from the data.

## [SQL for Data Analysis](SQL-for-Data-Analysis/README.md)

Extract and analyze a data set using SQL. Use data gathered from a query result to find answers to business questions and visualize it to make it easier to understand. The project in this section is to analyze a digital music store in how data gathered from their database may help the company.

#### :dart: [PROJECT - Query a Digital Music Store Database](SQL-for-Data-Analysis/L4-Project-Query-Music-Store/README.md)

>In this project, you will query a digital music store database which holds information regarding the store’s media, employees, and customers.

## [Data Visualization](Data-Visualization/README.md)
This section takes data visualizations to another level. Use Tableau to analyze and visualize large data sets, and create informative and dynamic data dashboards. This section makes it easier to visualize large data sets in a more readable form in order to present insights to all business areas.

#### :dart: [PROJECT- Build Data Dashboards](Data-Visualization/L5-Project-Build-Data-Dashboard/README.md)

>In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more.
